## Research

My PhD research is focused on using machine learning to support the management of blood inventory. I am particularly interested in using real-time data about the state of a hospital to improve institution-level forecasts and using reinforcement learning to recommend replenishment and allocation decisions.

I am supervised by [Dr Kezhi (Ken) Li](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KLIXX57), [Dr Wai Keong Wong](https://www.uclhospitals.brc.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/team/dr-wai-keong-wong), and [Prof Martin Utley](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=MLUTL84).

My work is generously supported by UKRI training grant [EP/S021612/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FS021612%2F1) and the [NIHR UCLH BRC](https://www.uclhospitals.brc.nihr.ac.uk/).

## Background

I completed a BA in Natural Sciences at [Gonville and Caius College](https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge in 2010 and an MSc in Machine Learning at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) in 2019.

I qualified as a chartered accountant (ACA) in 2014 while working in external audit at [Crowe](https://www.crowe.com/uk), and subsequently spent four years as a forensic accountant at [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/explore/home.html).
